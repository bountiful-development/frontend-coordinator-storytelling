          That's a son of a gun of a cloud. We'll paint one happy little tree
          right here. I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke
          Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. Absolutely no
          pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. In
          painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move
          mountains. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. It
          is a lot of fun. There comes a nice little fluffer. Everyone is going
          to see things differently - and that's the way it should be.
          Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being
          creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul.
          That's crazy. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your
          entire perspective. It is a lot of fun. There comes a nice little
