              That's a son of a gun of a cloud. We'll paint one happy little
              tree right here. I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van
              Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue.
              Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a
              mountain. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the
              ability to move mountains. We'll lay all these little funky little
              things in there. It is a lot of fun. There comes a nice little
              fluffer. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's
              the way it should be. Exercising the imagination, experimenting
              with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the
              windows to your soul. That's crazy. Just take out whatever you
              don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. It is a lot of
              fun. There comes a nice little fluffer. Everyone is going to see
