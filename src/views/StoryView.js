                That's a son of a gun of a cloud. We'll paint one happy little
                tree right here. I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use
                Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian
                Blue. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating
                across a mountain. In painting, you have unlimited power. You
                have the ability to move mountains. We'll lay all these little
                funky little things in there. It is a lot of fun. There comes a
                nice little fluffer. Everyone is going to see things differently
                - and that's the way it should be. Exercising the imagination,
                experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me,
                are truly the windows to your soul. That's crazy. Just take out
                whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective.
